The goal of {squash} is to compile a single html presentation file from multiple independent quarto files.

The main purpose of this is to create custom slide decks from several chapter quarto files.

The resulting html file can be themed via quarto extensions.

## Installation

You can install the **stable** version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Thinkr-open/squash) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/squash", ref = "production")
```


You can install the **development** version from [GitHub](https://github.com/Thinkr-open/squash) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("Thinkr-open/squash", ref = "main")
```

This package relies on quarto > 1.3 (see its [download page](https://quarto.org/docs/download/)).

## Play with `{squash}`

### Simple case

```{r}
library(squash)
```

Given a vector containing path to several .qmd chapters.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# list example qmds from /inst
courses_path <- system.file(
  "courses",
  "M01",
  package = "squash"
)

# copy example qmds in a tempdir
tmp_course_path <- tempfile(pattern = "course")
dir.create(tmp_course_path)

file.copy(
  from = courses_path,
  to = tmp_course_path,
  recursive = TRUE
)

qmds <- list.files(
  path = tmp_course_path,
  full.names = TRUE,
  recursive = TRUE,
  pattern = "qmd$"
)

qmds
```

And a directory where you want your course to be generated.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# generate html in temp folder
temp_dir <- tempfile(pattern = "compile")
```

You can use the function `compile_qmd_course()` to compile a course.

> We wrap the function call inside a `progressr::with_progress()` to see the progress bar. You can also set it in the console with `progressr::handlers(global = TRUE)`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
html_output <- progressr::with_progress(
  compile_qmd_course(
    vec_qmd_path = qmds,
    output_dir = temp_dir,
    output_html = "complete_course.html"
  )
)
```

Check out the result
```{r eval=FALSE}
browseURL(html_output)
```

Clean temporary example directory.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
unlink(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE)
unlink(tmp_course_path, recursive = TRUE)
```
